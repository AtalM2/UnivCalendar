------------------------------
Funambol Caldav Connector Version 1.0.0
 - rpolli@babel.it -
 - pventura@babel.it -
 
Installation
------------------------------

Connector capabilities
----------------------
The Caldav Connector can synchronize x-vcalendar icalendar  and SIF-E events with a caldav server.


Tested capabilities
-------------------------
Following are tested capabilities:
-insertion/update/delete/retrieval of simple events from Nokia E65 (format vcal). Events are stored in ICAL format 
on Bedework calendar server.
-insertion/update/delete/retrieval of simple events  from Outlook (format SIFE). Events are stored in ICAL format
on Bedework calendar server.  

Some properties are still not supported (busy-status, partecipants).

Installation requirements
-------------------------
Now you don't need a patched funambol-foundation connector for managing non
 icalendar events (this will no more be required as soon as possible)


Building
-------------------------
Issue 
# mvn -e package
and you'll find the .s4j in the target/ directory
